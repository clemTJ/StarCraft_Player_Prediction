Kaggle - StarCraft 2 Player Prediction Challenge 2020, Can you predict who is playing a game?

We consider the video game StarCraft 2. This real-time strategy game is played competitively by cyber-athletes as an electronic sport (esport), and most of the competitions are played online. A major issue for competition organizers is that they need to verify the identify of a player, for being sure that it is not another player (a friend with better chances, ...).

For that matter, we intend to study how it is possible to determine who is playing given a behavioral trace (game events produced by the player) by designing a prediction model using machine learning techniques.
